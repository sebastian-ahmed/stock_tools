class StockTransactor:
    '''
    Implements the processing layer of stock transactions. An object of this class is 
    responsible for the following operations:
    - Reading in of a stock transaction data file (using either CSV or JSON formats)
    - Processing all transactions in the file
    - Matching sales relative to previous purchases using either the
      First-in-first-out (FIFO) default ordering or ordering with specified buy lots
    - Error checks
        - Date order of transactions
        - Sales of non-existing or insufficient securities
    - Writing of reconciled sales to an output file (with write_sales_file())
        - Erroneous transactions are reported and ignored in the output
        - Sales which span multiple buy lots are split out as multiple sales
          each with their own cost basis and long-term/short-term designation

    Experimental functionality:
    - There currently exists a number of methods which add support for interactive addition
      of transactions such as through a command-line-interface. This includes features such
      as undoing a transaction or detecting erroneous sales which are rolled back and ignored.
